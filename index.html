                <p class="paragraph">
                Our Sun (a star) and all the planets around it are
                part of a galaxy known as the Milky Way Galaxy. A
                galaxy is a large group of stars, gas, and dust bound 
                together by gravity. They come in a variety of 
                shapes and sizes. The Milky Way is a large barred 
                spiral galaxy. All the stars we see in the night sky
                are in our own Milky Way Galaxy. Our galaxy is 
                called the Milky Way because it appears as a milky
                band of light in the sky when you see it in a really 
                dark area.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The Milky Way is visible from Earth as a hazy band of white light,
                some 30Â° wide, arching the night sky.In night sky observing, 
                although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are 
                part of the Milky Way Galaxy, the term "Milky Way" is limited to
                this band of light.The light originates from the accumulation
                of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the
                galactic plane. Brighter regions around the band appear as soft visual
                patches known as star clouds. The most conspicuous of these is the 
                Large Sagittarius Star Cloud, a portion of the central bulge of the galaxy.
                Dark regions within the band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are 
                areas where interstellar dust blocks light from distant stars. The area of
                sky that the Milky Way obscures is called the Zone of Avoidance.

                The Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility
                can be greatly reduced by background light, such as light pollution 
                or moonlight. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per
                square arcsecond in order for the Milky Way to be visible. It should
                be visible if the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better
                and shows a great deal of detail at it.This makes the Milky
                Way difficult to see from brightly lit urban or suburban areas, but
                very prominent when viewed from rural areas when the Moon is below
                the horizon.Maps of artificial night sky brightness show that
                more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way
                from their homes due to light pollution.
